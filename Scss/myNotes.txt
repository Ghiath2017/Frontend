* There're two files, they don't compiling
    - One for the Varibles, it calls (partials/_varibles) . But it import without underscore.
    - One for the Functions, it calls (partials/_mixins) . But it import without underscore as well.
    - We can import both of them at one line as the following : 
        import "partials/_mixins", "partials/_varibles";
